Note: 
The app used is Flask, and it's run on the local host.
The database is used for the bot to learn on the fly as more data comes in.
The only files that you need to run are train.py (run first), and app.py (run second).
You can ignore other files and folders.

The following steps show you how to run the program:

Step 1: You need vscode, Pip and python (any python version 3.5 and up should work).
Step 2: Virtual environment is recommended, run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all dependencies.
Step 3: Run train.py first, a db.sqlite3 database will popup -> this will be the data to train the chatbot.
Step 4: Run app.py, which will run locally on your browser, click on the local link and start using the bot.
